    <h1>How to make a website?</h1>
    <p1>o make a website, you start by writing the structure using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which defines the content and layout of the page. Then, you style the design using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. You can add interactivity using JavaScript for things like buttons or animations. Once your website files are ready, you can host them online using free platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, making your website accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This process allows you to build anything from personal portfolios to full websites, even from home.</p1>
